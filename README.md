# Interlok XML Security Testing

This test project focuses on the encryption and decryption services
using the XML security component.

It current has two services in one workflow (encrypt then decrypt) and
two service tester test cases. The dummy data used in the service tester
is the same as that in the unit tests in the xml-security project. The
keystore is a dummy keystore only used locally for testing. (You likely
have you own for similar purposes or you will have to use the one
included here and update the configuration to point to it.)
